See also Areas of mathematics and Glossary of areas of mathematics.

As a rough guide this list is divided into pure and applied sections although in reality these branches are overlapping and intertwined.

Pure mathematics
Algebra
Algebra includes the study of algebraic structures, which are sets and operations defined on these sets satisfying certain axioms. The field of algebra is further divided according to which structure is studied; for instance, group theory concerns an algebraic structure called group.
